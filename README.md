### Components used in application

The Polaris project consists of five main components, each serving a specific function within the application. These components are dynamically loaded onto the form page based on JSON data retrieved from a remote server.

1. EditTextFormField: Allows users to input text data into the form.
2. CheckBoxesFormField: Provides a list of options for users to select multiple choices.
3. DropDownFormField: Presents a dropdown menu for users to choose a single option from a list.
4. RadioGroupFormField: Displays a group of radio buttons for users to select a single option.
5. CaptureImagesFormField: Enables users to capture and upload images directly within the form.


These components are essential for collecting various types of data from users and facilitating seamless interaction with the app's features. By dynamically loading them based on JSON configuration, the app ensures flexibility and scalability in accommodating different form structures and requirements.
